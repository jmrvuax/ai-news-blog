        <h2>About this site</h2>
        <p>This site is a simple example of a PHP application that uses the front controller pattern. The front controller is a design pattern that routes requests to the appropriate handler based on the request URI. In this example, the front controller is implemented in the index.php file, which includes the appropriate template based on the request URI.</p>
